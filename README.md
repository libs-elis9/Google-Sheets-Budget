# Google-Sheets-Budget
_A script to apply custom, conditional data validation in a Google Sheets budget ledger_

This is a personal project. It's designed for a specific Google Sheet that others may not have access to, but the code is open and available for anyone who wants to learn from it, experiment, or build on top of it.

When working in Google Sheets, I wanted to take data validation a step further. I have a main ledger sheet where I sort transactions into different sub-budgets, but I also wanted to sub-categorize those items based on the individual budget they belong to.

Since standard data validation in Sheets doesn’t support this kind of conditional logic out of the box, I wrote a script to make it possible. Now I can input everything into my ledger, run the script, and automatically get custom validations that match each budget’s unique sub-categories.

It’s a specific use case, but I’m sharing it in case it helps someone else—or sparks ideas for customizing Sheets in powerful ways.
